Adding some more data to understand and resolve merge conflict 
ex
Store input numbers
num1 = input('Enter first number: ')
num2 = input('Enter second number: ')

# Add two numbers
sum = float(num1) + float(num2)

# Display the summ
print('The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1
print('The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum)
we adding code locally by not pulling updated changes from GH
